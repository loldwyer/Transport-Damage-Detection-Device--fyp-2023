# Transport Damage Detection Device - FYP 2022/23
**For this project you will need Grove Beginner Kit**

## Objective
Created a system for logistics and supply chain management that utilized microcontroller-based embedded systems (using the Grove Beginner Kit) to implement real-time monitoring and reporting of the condition of goods during transportation.

## Programming Languages
- **HTML:** Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** Presentation of the webpage.
- **JavaScript:** Webpage interactivity.
- **Arduino Code:** 
  - Read and write data from the sensors.
  - Control actuators based on commands received from the server.

## Technologies
- **jQuery:** Enhances the web interface.
- **Express.js:** Handles server-side logic.
- **Node.js:** Facilitates server-side logic.
- **Socket.io:** Enables real-time communication between the client and the server.

## Accomplishments
- Utilized a 3-axis acceleration sensor to detect potential damage from sudden or excessive motion.
- Triggered the on-board LED and buzzers when damage was detected.
- Wrote messages to the OLED display upon detection and/or handling of damage.
- Designed and developed a web page interface that interacted with the embedded system, displaying live data and sending notifications to a remote user.
- Added functionality to the webpage that aids in the management of loss control.
